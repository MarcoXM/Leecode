# Why Leecode ?


In my graduate days, I have learned many aspect in computer science as well as data analytics! Itâ€™s taught in a course called **Algorithms and Data Structures**. 

And I believe that LeetCode is a good platform filled with algorithm questions so I can KEEP practicing these skilles for future interviews, the best way is to learn algorithms and data structures thoroughly, and then practice continuously.

That is the reason why I set up this Leecode puzzles solutions repository.
